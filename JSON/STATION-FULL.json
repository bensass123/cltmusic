Maddie Duncan (Vocals/Guitar) gets deep in her head and takes you along on her emotional self-discovery and exploration of personal feelings. Through what can be described as emotive indie rock, Duncan uses her lyrics to walk you through her self-diagnosis, relentless efforts to cope, and eventual repetition of the clinical cycle. Their upbeat songs radiate fake happiness as a mask for the persistent feeling of sadness or loss of interest that characterizes what is actually being said. The band’s upcoming full-length features danceable pop rock radio hits - if the radio was playing in the waiting room of a psychiatrist’s office. \nworldsgreatestdadmusic.bandcamp.com\n\ndollhands:\nlocal garage rock band that plays at the station at least once every 2 weeks\ndollhands.bandcamp.com\n\nplaceholder: \nlocal rock & freakin roll band with cookout on the brain, dominos; hire nick\nplaceholdernc.bandcamp.com","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1386857258101359"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"Purple Hearts & Demi the Daredevil: Charlotte, NC","date":"09/23/2017","times":"8:00 PM","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1948297585390511","desc":"HEART TO HEART TOUR:\nJoin Purple Hearts and Demi the Daredevil at:\nThe Station in Charlotte, North Carolina on September 23rd.\n\nBANDS:\n\nPurple Hearts\nwww.facebook.com/purpleheartsofficial\n\nDemi The Daredevil\nwww.facebook.com/demithedaredevil\n\nThe Kneads\nwww.facebook.com/thekneads\nhttp://thekneads.weebly.com/\n\nMotel Glory\nhttps://motelglory.bandcamp.com/\n\nDoors 8pm || 9pm Show || $5 || $8 (under 21)","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1948297585390511"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"Jistu w/ Bird Laww, The House Cats, Mercury Dimes at The Station","date":"09/16/2017","times":"8:00 PM","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.facebook.com/events/323512044753505","desc":"Jistu // Bird Laww // The House Cats // Mercury Dimes at The Station (9.16)\n\nJistu:\nHigh energy, punk inspired, funk infused music to move, groove, and drink to.\nhttps://play.spotify.com/artist/3vyGCbrZaf7lHJcO7RZ8Dp\n\nBird Laww: \nAlternative Pop-Rock band from Atlanta, Ga.\nhttps://m.soundcloud.com/birdlaww\n\nThe House Cats:\nCharlotte Rock N Roll Soul with hard hitting groves.\n \nMercury Dimes:\nhttps://themercurydimes.bandcamp.com/\n\nDoors 8pm || Show 9 || $5 || $8 (18-20) || 18+","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/323512044753505"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"Arson Daily w/ 40oz Mouse, The Remarks, and Big Ole Team (9.15)","date":"09/15/2017","times":"10:30 PM","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.facebook.com/events/302893690159092","desc":"Arson Daily // 40oz Mouse // The Remarks // Big Ole Team at The Station (9.15)\n\nArson Daily: https://www.facebook.com/thearsondaily/\n\n40oz Mouse: https://www.facebook.com/40ozmouse/\n\nThe Remarks: https://www.facebook.com/theremarksband/\n\nBig Ole Team \n\nDoors 8pm || Show 9:30pm || $5 || $8 (18-20) || 18+","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/302893690159092"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"Female Gibson/ Birds With Teeth/ Business People/ Monster Crux","date":"09/14/2017","times":"8:00 PM","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1933703726872830","desc":"Thursday, September 14th at the Station!\n\nFemale Gibson: https://www.facebook.com/Femalegibson/ \n\nBirds With Teeth: https://www.facebook.com/BirdsWithTeeth/\n\nThe Business People: https://www.facebook.com/thebusinesspeople/\n\nMonster Crux: https://www.facebook.com/CruxMonster/\n\nDoors 8pm || Show 9:30pm || $5 || $8 (18-20) || 18+","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1933703726872830"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"Eyes of Love // The Cradle // Buck Gooter // Zodiac Lovers","date":"09/11/2017","times":"8:00 PM","tuneStub":"","href":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1566806740053682","desc":"Monday, September 11th at the Station!\n\nEyes of Love: https://wharfcatrecords.bandcamp.com/album/eyes-of-love-ep\n\nThe Cradle: https://thecradle.bandcamp.com/\n\nBuck Gooter: https://buckgooter.bandcamp.com/\n\nZodiac Lovers: https://zodiaclovers.bandcamp.com/\n\nDoors 8pm || Show 9:30pm || $5 || $8 (18-20) || 18+","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.facebook.com/events/1566806740053682"},{"venue":"The Station","event":"David Z.
