A native of Syracuse, York has spent years writing in the indie rock vein, with influences that span from Pop to Experimental. Building on the success of previous projects such as the rock outfit Animal Pants, Major Player is Indie Rock rooted in Soul and R&B.York first broke ground on Major Player with help from drummer Liz Strodel and producer Andrew Greacen. What began as an experiment in hip-hop beat-making transformed into a full fledged indie rock ensemble. The latest configuration of Major Player includes Brent Spreter on Bass, Stephen Collie on drums, Ian Doherty and Deion Patterson on Keys.In the summer of 2016 Major Player released its debut album “Extended Play.” The record is deliberate in its simplicity, intentionally lo-fi and moody. The tonality of these songs call up something dream like and familiar, making use of repetition and overlapping layers that build on one another. With lyrics that explore the shadowy faces of love and age, Major Player maintains a pop driven focus, while delivering dark creative melodies and catchy vocal hooks.","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1539447"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"Blackwater Drowning, Divine Treachery, Annabel Lee, Den of Wolves","date":"09 09 17","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"We are Blackwater Drowning, a metal band from western NC blending equal measures of melodic and aggressive elements to form a sound that has something to offer every listener.","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1533026"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"Kayo Dot, El Malpais, Pullover","date":"09 10 17","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"Kayo Dot is an American avant-rock/experimental music group that was formed in 2003 by Toby Driver. They released their debut album Choirs of the Eye on John Zorn's Tzadik Records label that year. Tzadik's descriptive label on that album reads: \"Kayo Dot powerfully integrates elements of modern classical composition with the layers of guitars and vocals more common to rock and metal. With a compositional map that is strict in form yet malleable in execution, Kayo Dot uses a vast array of instrumentation to create an exciting convergence of violence and serenity.\"Since then, Kayo Dot's music has undergone several identity shifts, largely influenced by the band's constantly-changing lineup and instrumentation. One predominant element of Driver's compositional voice which remains consistent throughout all of Kayo Dot's output, however, is the band's use of abstract timing and performance cues. This lends to the music the element of \"malleability\" mentioned in Tzadik's description above.The music of Kayo Dot is commonly categorized as post-metal, post-rock, progressive rock, or avant-garde. Their songs involve complex instrumentation (composed by singer and frontman Driver). They are substantially longer than typical rock songs, usually ranging from 8 to 18 minutes in length.","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1529643"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"The Hooliganz, Destroi, The Commonwealth, Queen City Rejects","date":"09 14 17","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"The Hooliganz' music is for the working class, the working poor, degenerates, skinheads, punk rockers and hardcore kids.
