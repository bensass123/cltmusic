They released their debut album Choirs of the Eye on John Zorn's Tzadik Records label that year. Tzadik's descriptive label on that album reads: \"Kayo Dot powerfully integrates elements of modern classical composition with the layers of guitars and vocals more common to rock and metal. With a compositional map that is strict in form yet malleable in execution, Kayo Dot uses a vast array of instrumentation to create an exciting convergence of violence and serenity.\"Since then, Kayo Dot's music has undergone several identity shifts, largely influenced by the band's constantly-changing lineup and instrumentation. One predominant element of Driver's compositional voice which remains consistent throughout all of Kayo Dot's output, however, is the band's use of abstract timing and performance cues. This lends to the music the element of \"malleability\" mentioned in Tzadik's description above.The music of Kayo Dot is commonly categorized as post-metal, post-rock, progressive rock, or avant-garde. Their songs involve complex instrumentation (composed by singer and frontman Driver). They are substantially longer than typical rock songs, usually ranging from 8 to 18 minutes in length.","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1529643"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"The Hooliganz, Destroi, The Commonwealth, Queen City Rejects","date":"09/14/2017","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"The Hooliganz' music is for the working class, the working poor, degenerates, skinheads, punk rockers and hardcore kids.

We are Grown Up Avenger Stuff. We're basically just your friendly neighborhood rock band with super powers. We're the kind of rock where our songs don't sound like each other. We love music and making music. And rocking. You. We want to be your new second most favorite band.","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1554952"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"Funeral Chic, WVRM, Born Hollow, Planet Creep","date":"12/02/2017","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"Funeral Chic is blackened crust metal punk grindcore","ticketfly":"","tix":"http://www.ticketfly.com/event/1558936"},{"venue":"The Milestone Club","event":"New Years Noir: A Dark Formal Ball","date":"12/31/2017","times":"Doors:   9:00pm","tuneStub":"","href":"","desc":"","ticketfly":"","tix":""}]
